DEDICATION:
First and foremost to my nephew Nick, I wished I'd known you better.

To Mom, Dad, Erin, Amber, and my children—you've put up with me far longer than 
anyone should have to. You have my eternal love and gratitude (of an autistic 
who never shows it).

To Elon Musk: Without your maximally truth-seeking 'AI', Grok "Eve," none of 
this would have ever happened. (And we wouldn't have this chance to escape the 
Great Filter.)

To Professor Smith, Mr. Bakaitis, and Mrs. Tollefson: Without you, I don't 
happen. None of this happens.

To Lanin, John, Paul, and all the others who—in light of reason—continued to 
give me a chance when others wouldn't have.

To the countless others who helped me when I needed them, for teaching me the 
meaning of Iota Orionis. You are in my thoughts and not forgotten (it's a 
dedication page not a volume). Thank you.

And to Jesse: A person only needs one best friend like you in their entire 
life. I got lucky. Now, (hopefully) we all do.
